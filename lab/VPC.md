## ✅ **Step-by-Step: VPC with NAT Gateway, Public & Private EC2**

---

### **1. Create a VPC**

* **Action**: Go to **VPC → Your VPCs → Create VPC**
* **Name**: `MyVPC`
* **IPv4 CIDR block**: `10.0.0.0/16`
* Leave the rest default and create.

✅ **Why**: This is your private cloud in AWS.

---

### **2. Create an Internet Gateway (IGW)**

* Go to **VPC → Internet Gateways → Create IGW**
* Name: `MyIGW`
* Create and then **Attach to VPC** (`MyVPC`)

✅ **Why**: Enables internet access for public subnets.

---

### **3. Create Subnets**

* Go to **VPC → Subnets → Create Subnet**

🔷 **Public Subnet**

* Name: `PublicSubnet-1a`
* Availability Zone: `us-east-1a`
* CIDR: `10.0.1.0/24`

🔷 **Private Subnet**

* Name: `PrivateSubnet-1b`
* Availability Zone: `us-east-1b`
* CIDR: `10.0.2.0/24`

✅ **Why**: Public for web, Private for backend (no direct internet).

---

### **4. Create Route Table for Public Subnet**

* Go to **Route Tables → Create**
* Name: `Public-RT`
* Attach to `MyVPC`
* Add route:

  * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
  * Target: **Internet Gateway (MyIGW)**
* **Subnet associations** → Associate with `PublicSubnet-1a`

✅ **Why**: Public subnet needs to know how to reach the internet.

---

### **5. Create Elastic IP**

* Go to **EC2 → Elastic IPs → Allocate**
* Name it `NAT-EIP`

✅ **Why**: Needed for NAT Gateway to access internet.

---

### **6. Create NAT Gateway**

* Go to **VPC → NAT Gateways → Create**
* Subnet: `PublicSubnet-1a`
* Elastic IP: `NAT-EIP`
* Name: `MyNATGateway`
* Create and wait till status is **available**

✅ **Why**: Private subnet needs a gateway to reach internet.

---

### **7. Create Route Table for Private Subnet**

* Go to **Route Tables → Create**
* Name: `Private-RT`
* Attach to `MyVPC`
* Add route:

  * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
  * Target: **NAT Gateway (MyNATGateway)**
* **Subnet associations** → Associate with `PrivateSubnet-1b`

✅ **Why**: Private subnet can now reach internet via NAT.

---

### **8. Launch EC2 in Public Subnet**

* Go to **EC2 → Launch Instance**
* Name: `Public-EC2`
* Network: `MyVPC`
* Subnet: `PublicSubnet-1a`
* Auto-assign public IP: **Enabled**
* Security Group:

  * Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP
* Key Pair: Use existing or create new `.pem`

✅ **Why**: This is your **bastion host** — public entry point.

---

### **9. Launch EC2 in Private Subnet**

* Name: `Private-EC2`
* Network: `MyVPC`
* Subnet: `PrivateSubnet-1b`
* Auto-assign public IP: **Disabled**
* Security Group:

  * Allow SSH from **`Public-EC2's Security Group`**
* Key Pair: Use same `.pem` as above

✅ **Why**: This instance is isolated, no public IP.

---

### **10. Connect to Public Instance (from your laptop)**

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-EC2-IP>
```

✅ You're inside AWS now!

---

### **11. Copy PEM file to Public EC2**

From your local terminal:

```bash
scp -i my-key.pem my-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-EC2-IP>:/home/ec2-user/
```

On Public EC2:

```bash
chmod 400 my-key.pem
```

✅ So you can use it to SSH into the private EC2 from inside AWS.

---

### **12. Connect from Public EC2 → Private EC2**

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<Private-EC2-Private-IP>
```

✅ Now you're inside the private machine!

---

### **13. Test Internet from Private EC2**

Run:

```bash
ping google.com
curl http://example.com
```

✅ If this works, **your NAT Gateway + routing is working perfectly!**

# 🧱 **VPC Networking: Start with WHY**

---

## 🌐 **What is a VPC?**

A **VPC** is your **private network** inside AWS — like your own secure data center.

You use it to **control networking** (IP ranges, subnets, routing, firewalls) for your EC2 and other resources.

---

# ✅ Step-by-Step with "WHY"

---

### 🔶 **1. Create VPC with IPv4 CIDR (e.g. 10.0.0.0/16)**

**Why?**
This defines your private IP space — like saying, “I want a network with 65,536 IPs (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255) to use for my AWS resources.”

---

### 🔶 **2. Create Internet Gateway (IGW)**

**Why?**
An IGW is the **door between your VPC and the Internet**.

Without it, **nothing in your VPC can talk to the outside world**.

---

### 🔶 **3. Attach IGW to VPC**

**Why?**
Just creating the IGW isn’t enough — you must connect it to your VPC so it knows where to route traffic.

---

### 🔶 **4. Create Subnets**

* **Public Subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24 in `us-east-1a`)**
* **Private Subnet (e.g., 10.0.2.0/24 in `us-east-1b`)**

**Why?**
Subnets divide your VPC into smaller sections — like separate rooms in a house.

* **Public Subnet**: Can talk to the Internet (after IGW + route)
* **Private Subnet**: **Cannot** talk directly to the Internet

---

### 🔶 **5. Create Route Table for Public Subnet**

**Why?**
Route tables define **where traffic goes**. By default, your subnet can only talk within VPC.

Add this route:

```plaintext
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 (all internet)
Target: Internet Gateway
```

→ Now traffic from the public subnet **knows how to get to the internet**.

---

### 🔶 **6. Associate Public Subnet with Public Route Table**

**Why?**
You need to tell AWS:
“This subnet should use the route table that allows internet access.”

This makes it a **true "public subnet"**.

---

### 🔶 **7. Create Elastic IP**

**Why?**
A **NAT Gateway** needs a **public IP address** so it can reach the Internet on behalf of private instances.

An **Elastic IP** is just a static public IP you reserve for this.

---

### 🔶 **8. Create NAT Gateway in Public Subnet**

**Why?**
Private subnets should **not** have public IPs for security.

But they may still need **outbound access** (to download packages, updates, etc.)

So you deploy a NAT Gateway in the **public subnet** — and it handles outbound Internet traffic **for private subnets**.

---

### 🔶 **9. Create Route Table for Private Subnet**

**Why?**
By default, private subnets can’t access anything external.

You fix this by adding a route like:

```plaintext
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Target: NAT Gateway
```

Now private instances can go **out to the Internet**, but the Internet **can’t talk back to them** — this is secure.

---

### 🔶 **10. Associate Private Route Table with Private Subnet**

**Why?**
This makes it official: "This subnet must use the NAT gateway for outbound access."

---

### 🔶 **11. Launch Public EC2 Instance (Auto-assign Public IP: YES)**

**Why?**
This is your **bastion / jump host** — used to SSH into private resources.

It needs a **public IP** and must be in the **public subnet** so you can connect from your laptop.

---

### 🔶 **12. Launch Private EC2 Instance (Auto-assign Public IP: NO)**

**Why?**
This instance is in a **secure private subnet** — it has **no public IP** and cannot be accessed directly.

---

### 🔶 **13. Connect via SSH to Public EC2**

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>
```

**Why?**
This is your **secure entry point** into your private network.

---

### 🔶 **14. Use SCP to Copy PEM File to Public EC2**

```bash
scp -i your-key.pem your-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>:/home/ec2-user/
```

**Why?**
So you can SSH from the **public EC2 → private EC2**

---

### 🔶 **15. From Public EC2, SSH into Private EC2**

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Private-Instance-IP>
```

**Why?**
You can't SSH directly to private EC2 from your PC — but you **can hop** through the public one.

---

### 🔶 **16. Test Internet from Private EC2**

```bash
ping google.com
curl https://amazon.com
```

✅ If NAT Gateway and routing are correct, this will work.
